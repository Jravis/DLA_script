This is a collection of python scripts for analyzing DLAs, 
as used to generate the plots in 1209.2118.
Depends on numpy, scipy, matplotlib and h5py.

Particle data (not included) is assumed to be HDF5 snapshot outputs of Gadget or Arepo.
SPH interpolation can be accelerated using scipy.weave, as the pure python version is unreasonably slow.

halohi.py contains functions for calculating various useful properties of DLAs.

dla_plots.py contains plotting functions

make_dla_plots.py contains a script for making the particular plots in the paper. 

cold_gas.py has the implementation of the self-shielding correction.

Because making the plots is significantly faster than doing the SPH interpolation, 
and will normally be done significantly more often, there is a facility for saving 
the computed column density grids to an hdf5 file and loading them again. 
make_a_grid.py performs the interpolation, and make_all_grids.pl submits jobs 
to do this to the IAS cluster.

There are also a few files to do Lyman-alpha forest analyses.
